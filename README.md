What worked: 	
	
		-Our game was able to be implemented in a start to finish manner.  We have
		a final working single-player game.  
		


What was hard:	
		
		-We encountered some issues as a group with SourceTree.  We have two team
		members with Macs and for whatever reason one teammember's Sourcetree was
		not rendering the version of our game we were working on from our GitHub
		repository.  Our group solution was to work on the project not simulationsly
		and then zip the project and send it to one another via email.  This was the
		only way we were able to overcome the hurdle of not being able to work on 
		SourceTree. 
		
Known Issues/What didn't work
		-We attempted to add sound effects when the player successfully stacks a block onto the tower,
		but even using the Unity Audio presentation as a guide it wouldn't work. Most of the code
		found online appeared to be outdated.
		-We tried to make it so that if the hangover length (amount the block hangs over the tower)
		was small enough, it wouldn't get cut to a smaller size. It currently gets cut even the smallest
		amount unless it's an absolutely perfect hit, so we wanted to give some leeway to give a longer
		playtime.
